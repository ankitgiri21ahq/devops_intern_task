## Introduction

Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable units called **containers**.  
Containers ensure that applications run consistently across different environments such as **development**, **testing**, and **production**.

### Why use Docker?
- ðŸš€ **Portability**: Run anywhere â€” local machine, cloud, or servers.  
- ðŸ”„ **Consistency**: Same environment across all stages.  
- âš¡ **Speed**: Faster setup compared to virtual machines.  
- ðŸ“¦ **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight.
